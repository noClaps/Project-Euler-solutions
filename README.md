# Project Euler Solutions
This repo contains solutions for the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems. The solutions for different languages are in their respective language folders.

## Disclaimer
I am not a professional programmer, and the programs I write may not be the best or most optimised solutions to the problems.

## Credits
I personally use [Nayuki's solutions](https://www.nayuki.io/page/project-euler-solutions) ([Github](https://github.com/nayuki/Project-Euler-solutions)) to check if my final answer is correct, but I write and optimise my code myself.

Obviously, credits to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) for the problems.

# Contributing guidelines

Generally, I won't accept contributions to this repository. This is meant to be a learning experience for me, and while I appreciate your contribution, I want to learn solving the Project Euler problems myself.

That said, if you have any tips or advice for how I can improve my code, feel free to open an issue.

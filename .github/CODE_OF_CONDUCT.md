# Code of Conduct

Be kind and respectful when opening or participating in issues, PRs or discussions. That being said, if I sense that a discussion is getting too heated, out of hand or off-topic, I will close it, whether you like it or not. This is decided by me, noClaps, the owner of this repository, and anyone else I may appoint to moderate issues, PRs and discussions.

If you have any complaints or requests regarding the behavior of other users in this repository, or questions about the details and/or enforcement of this Code of Conduct, you can let us know by opening an issue and pinging one of the [moderators](#moderators). We will get back to you as soon as possible. Reports help us catch users who are breaking the rules more quickly and easily, and make the community a more pleasant place overall.

## The Rules

1.  **No discrimination against users.** This repository is open to all people, regardless of their level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, age, or religion.
2.  **Keep swears and curse words at a minimum.** While I respect the freedom of speech, I will not tolerate cursing and swearing being used inappropriately. Let's try to keep all conversations family-friendly.
3.  **Criticise constructively, not destructively.** Constructive criticism helps improve the project and the community in general, whereas destructive criticism limits creativity and ruins the vibe of the community in general. Be respectful toward others and help everyone improve.

    This goes the other way too: Take criticism from others. You may not always be right, and even if you are, communicate your point clearly and respectfully. Civilised discussions will lead to far more progress than chaotic arguments.
4.  **Keep your beef out of here.** I don't want arguments over external matters in my repository. Get it out of here.

## Enforcement

Anyone caught breaking these rules will be given a warning and linked to this Code of Conduct. If the behaviour continues, they will be banned permanently from contributing to this project.

## Moderators
Moderators will be chosen by the owner of this repository. The current list of moderators is:
